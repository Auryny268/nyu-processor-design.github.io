# Week of September 11, 2023
Project Work:
  * Read up on GitHub functionality (mainly Repos, Branches, Forks, and Pull Requests)
  * Created first design notebook entry

Admittedly I won't have much time this semester, so my goal is to at least complete the onboarding labs. I aim to start (and ideally complete) Onboarding Lab 1 by the end of next week.

<chore>: Finish onboarding lab 1; learn how to use git in Anubis.

I started Onboarding Lab 1: I made my first CML file using Anubis, and got "Hello World" to print in the terminal. Still unsure how to directly link my work in Anubis to the Github repository, will ask Vito about it this Tuesday.\\

For this upcoming week, I want to finish Onboarding Lab 1. This week, I didn't make the stupid mistake of grading multiple homework problems so hopefully I'll have time.
