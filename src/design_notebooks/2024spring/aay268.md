## Week of February 11, 2024
Project Work:
  * Finished (Onboarding Lab 2)[https://github.com/Auryny268/onboarding-lab-2]
  * Worked on Onboarding Lab 3 - (WIP)[https://github.com/Auryny268/onboarding-lab-3]

I enrolled late into the course so this is my first design notebook entry. 

I got really stuck on Onboarding Lab 3: I have the general idea of how each test should be implemented but got really wrapped up in the details. I kept trying to think of ways to write my code cleaner (despite not yet having the tools to do so), which really slowed me down. I've also been learning how the models work through the tests written for Onboarding Lab 2, plus a lot of trial and error.

This upcoming week, I'm gonna try to finish Onboarding Lab 3 and Onboarding Lab 4. I'm not sure how much further I'll get since I'm also quite ill right now.

Project Work:
* Finished [Onboarding Lab 3](https://github.com/Auryny268/onboarding-lab-3)
* Finished [Onboarding Lab 4](https://github.com/Auryny268/onboarding-lab-4)

I finally completed all the onboarding labs. Lab 3 ended up being super tricky for me. When I got really stuck I ended up heavily referencing Michael's completed labs - my exercise 1 is identical to his as I didn't (and still don't) understand if the model will allocate more bits than necessary to what we've defined for a input/output. However when I got to Lab 4, I took more inspiration from Vito's code (from Lab 2) and made my solutions way more concise.

I also talked to Vito during the makeup meeting and will be joining AMBA.


## Week of February 25, 2024
Project Work:
* Read Ch. 1 and Sections 5.1-5.2 of the AMBA Specs
* Started brainstorming diagram of APB Manager

I talked to Rishyak on Tuesday, and I've decided to work on the APB Manager. I read the "Introduction to the AMBA Buses" to learn how the AMBA buses work together in general. I asked a lot of questions about the bus signals and what "speed" meant in regards to the different buses, which ended up sparking a lot of discussion and debate in the `dev` channel (oopsies). I am very grateful for everyone who responded to me - I feel more comfortable with the high-impedance state and purpose of multi-driver wires. I also appreciate the Physics II review from Michael and Krzysztof.

I also read the first two sections of Ch. 5, which were about the APB manager, and drew a rough mock-up of my plans for its implementation.

I am still shaky on the timing of the data transfers, so I'm currently awaiting feedback from Rishyak.
